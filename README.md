# Continuous Learning: Golang

Learning Golang for Ops and Site Reliability Engineering. 

## Why Go for Ops and SRE? 

* Open Source.
* Simple, reliable and efficient. 
* Testing, benchmarking and profiling built-in.
* Good standard libraries.
* Concurrency via goroutines and channels.
* Google's definition SRE is a software engineer running operations. 
* SREs normally write tools and projects which are more complex than 'scripts' - let's eliminate real toils! :P
* Go in production at Google and outside!
